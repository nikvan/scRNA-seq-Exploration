# scRNA-seq-Exploration

Based on code from: https://www.krishnaswamylab.org/workshop

This scrips takes labeled data from retinal bipolar cells upon which neural networks are built in PyTorch. Here, we will show that a neural network can recapitulate the cell type labels.

Scripts use the package scprep.
